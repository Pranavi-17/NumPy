# Project Title:
### Analysis of Cricket Tournament eligibility using NumPy for upcoming Match league.


# Tools & Technology:
### 1.Jupyter-Notebook
### 2.Python Programming Language
### 3.Numpy (Python Library)
### 4.Google Colab

# Problem Statement:
### A panel wants to select players for an upcoming league match based on their fitness. Players from all significant cricket clubs have participated in a practice match, and their data is collected. Let us now explore NumPy features using the player's data.

# Project Approach:
### 1.Importing the numpy library
### 2.Convert the lists into NumPy arrays
### 3.Multiplication with a factor
### 4.Deriving new data from existing
### 5.Indexing through arrays
### 6.Subsets
